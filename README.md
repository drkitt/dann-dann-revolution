Dann Dann Revolution is a game that I collaborated to make as a final project for Computer Science 40S at Dakota Collegiate in the 2017/2018 school year. It's here to be viewed by employers as a showcase of our skills. üë©‚Äçüíªüòé

The game uses a custom engine that I started to develop in the summer before that school year, using C# and the Monogame framework (the engine is nicknamed the Tribute Engine, which is why some files date back to summer 2017 and/or are labelled "Project Tribute").

## Getting started
These instructions will help you get a copy of the project open on your machine so you can play the game.
### Prerequisites
You will need:
- Visual Studio for Windows (tested with Visual Studio 2019) 
- [Monogame 3.6 for Visual Studio](https://www.monogame.net/2017/03/01/monogame-3-6/) (make sure you have the right version; the game doesn't work on Monogame 3.7)
### Opening the Visual Studio project (and starting the game!)
