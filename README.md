Dann Dann Revolution is a game that I collaborated to make as a final project for Computer Science 40S at Dakota Collegiate in the 2017/2018 school year. It's here to be viewed by employers as a showcase of our skills. üë©‚Äçüíªüòé

The game uses a custom engine that I started to develop in the summer before that school year, using C# and the Monogame framework (the engine is nicknamed the Tribute Engine, which is why some files date back to summer 2017 and/or are labelled "Project Tribute").

## Getting started
These instructions will help you get a copy of the project open on your machine so you can play the game.
### Prerequisites
You will need:
- Windows (tested on Windows 10 version 1909)
- Visual Studio for Windows with the C# workload installed (tested with Visual Studio 2019) 
- [Monogame 3.6 for Visual Studio](https://www.monogame.net/2017/03/01/monogame-3-6/) (make sure you have the right version; the game doesn't work on Monogame 3.7 'cause the video player is really finicky)
### Opening the Visual Studio project (and starting the game!)
0. View this repository's GitHub page (if you can read this, you're probably already there!).
1. From the `<>Code` tab, click the green button near the top-right that says `<Clone or download>`.
2. Click `<Download ZIP>`.
3. Once the file has finished downloading, use the File Explorer to navigate to your Downloads folder. 
4. In your Downloads folder, locate a file called `<dann-dann-revolution-master.zip>`
5. Extract the .zip file's contents to a convenient location.
6. Open the newly-extracted folder, double-click on the `<dann-dann-revolution-master>` folder, and finally double-click on the `<Dann Dann Revolution>` folder.
7. Double-click on `<Dann Dann Revolution.sln>`
8. Once Visual Studio has opened, press F5 to compile and start the game!
